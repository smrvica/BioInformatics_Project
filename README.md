Project "The Logarithmic Dynamic Cuckoo Filter" for https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/bio1 class.

Contributors:
- Petra Habjanec -> Cuckoo Node, Logarithmic Dynamic Cuckoo Filter, experiment scripts and tests
- Andrea MilanoviÄ‡ -> Bucket, Cuckoo Filter, Dynamic Cuckoo Filter, Hash Function, Linked Cuckoo List

To compile and run tests:
```
cd Bioinformatics_Project
test/test.sh
```

The project was based on the following paper:
